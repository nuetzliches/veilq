## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The repository: plan, workspace, CI.
- The contracts of M0 (ADR-0001 to ADR-0007): the report and policy schemas
  (`schema/`), keyed pseudonyms `[TYPE:hex8]`, exit codes 0/1/2, the policy
  file `veilq.toml` and where it is found, the four actions with `mask` by
  default, the model requirement, and the root a caller's paths stay under.
- `veilq policy check`: validates the policy a run would use and that the
  detectors it requires can run.
